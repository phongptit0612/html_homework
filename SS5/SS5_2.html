    <p >Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical
        songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the
        subject of extensive media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as Swifties.

        Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006)
        and Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" found
        crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on
        Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing
        media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100
        number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and
        "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>
